### DMAP (pan-cancer DNA Methylation Analysis Package)

This GitHub portal is for depositing the pan-cancer DNA Methylation Analysis Package (DMAP) and related analysis results for our recent ENCODE project.

This package is mainly for the analysis of pan-cancer DNA methylation data from the ENCODE Consortium portal. We have already use the package in our recent ENCODE project. All the curated reference sources and read-to-use pan-cancer analysis results are deposited at: http://github.com/gladex/DMAP.

We continuously update and revise the contents of this knowledgebase. Suggestion or recommendation to pan-cancer analysis repository, DMAP, is greatly appreciated at bh.tang@outlook.com. Any citation or usage of the toolkit, PanCanDMAT, please cite properly (DMAP: http://github.com/gladex/DMAP).
